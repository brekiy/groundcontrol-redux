    if you wish to setup specific things for the gamemode ON THE CLIENT, you should do it here
    this file will never be changed in future updates (except for being included in them), so you're free to adjust the gamemode as you see fit here 
    the code here will be run after everything in the gamemode has been initialized 
    
    this is also the best place for the "GroundControlPostInitEntity" hook (added with hook.Add as usual)
